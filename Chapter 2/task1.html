    <p><em>One of the main characters in the "Gyikaw" series.</em> Small in size, with white fur and a small round tail. The fur will grow longer when the weather gets colder, and if not trimmed, it will get prickly.

        Although a bit of a crybaby, she has a kind heart. She is introverted and shy, and acts cautiously and timidly, but will be agile and resourceful in critical moments to turn dangerous situations into safe ones.

        She has a delicate mind and will consider her friends, valuing friendship. When an important friend is in danger, she will display a full measure of courage.

        She makes a living by weeding, collecting, and hunting, and is currently studying hard for her fifth-level weeding certificate.

        She sings happily when she is alone.

        She sleeps with a brown teddy bear stuffed animal.

        Her hobby is lottery drawing. She has good luck and often wins prizes in various lottery drawings. She also lives in a house she won in a "Super Delicious Yogurt" lottery drawing. Advertisement</p>
