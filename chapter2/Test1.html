    Small in size,
    with white fur and a small round tail.
    The fur will grow longer when the weather gets colder,
    and if not trimmed, it will get prickly.

    Although a bit of a crybaby, she has a kind heart.
    She is introverted and shy, and acts cautiously and timidly,
    but will be agile and resourceful in critical
    moments to turn dangerous situations into safe ones.

    She has a delicate mind and will consider her friends,
    valuing friendship. When an important friend is in danger,
    she will display a full measure of courage.

    She makes a living by weeding, collecting, and hunting,
    and is currently studying hard for her fifth-level weeding certificate.

    She sings happily when she is alone.

    She sleeps with a brown teddy bear stuffed animal.

    Her hobby is lottery drawing. She has good luck and often wins prizes in various lottery drawings.
    She also lives in a house she won in a "Super Delicious Yogurt" lottery drawing. </p>
